# Problem Definition

Second Harvest sells raffle tickets at its events (e.g. Toronto Taste) – the raffle tickets are a good source of revenue and provide access to a list of potential donors.

Currently the tickets are paper based and information is entered on the raffle ticket stub manually by the buyer.

Second Harvest uses the information provided on the ticket stubs to capture donor information.  However it takes a lot of manual work effort to digitize this information.

Our challenge was to expedite the process of capturing and digitizing donor information.

# Solution

We have created a web app ‘ChanceIt’ that runs on web and mobile.  The app features include:

-	Admin login and user login – allows for better control over ticket sales process
-	Captures buyer and seller information
-	Is tied to a database in the backend
-	Creates an automated donor (mailing) list minimizing manual entry
-	Information captured enables campaign analytics and allows tracking of donor spends
